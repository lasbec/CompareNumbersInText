# What is it for?
This tool is made to check the numbers in translations of (technical) texts for consistency. So we are expecting the translation to contain the same numbers in the same order, as in the original text. Espacially when using modern AI for translation, like ChatGPT, there can be switched or missing numbers in the translation. 

# How to Use
You need to write a Excel file with titled columns for the two languages.
e.g.:



| ANSI  | EN               | ANSI  | DE                  |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| 12365 | Hello World!1!11 | 12368 | Hallo Welt!1!11!!!! |
| abc   | 3 deep 5 me      | abc   | zu tief f√ºr mich    |

When starting the progaram it requires the Path to the Excel and the name of the columns to compare, in this case "EN" and "DE".

In the example the first line will pass the test the second will fail.
